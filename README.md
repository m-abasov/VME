The project replicates the main results in Asness et al (2013) "Value and Momentum Everywhere" paper: 
- Corrlation table for value and momentum strategies for different asset classes and geographical markets;
- Principal component analysis for aggregate portfolios.

The raw data was shared by one of the authors. The calculations closely follow the methods used in the paper and match the qualitative conclusions.
